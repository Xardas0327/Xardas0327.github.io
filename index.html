								We have a saying in my country. The good priest studies until their death. I think this is really true 
								for developers. As a result, I spend time on evolve my skills or just I try a new 
								technologies.
								In my free time, I use the Unity and I create smaller/bigger games.
								I have done a games with VR and AR features. I learnt ML a bit, because I am interested in it, that it works exactly.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">In the future, if I have chance, I want to use more lower level languages like C or C++ or even assembly languages.</p>
							<p>
								Outside of programming, I like going to cinema, playing video games, read books and spending time with my friends.
								I spent a lot of time with Word of Warcraft. But my favorite video game series is the Gothic and I really like the LEGO BIONICLE.
								I am interested in the mythologies (mostly Greece and Egypt).
