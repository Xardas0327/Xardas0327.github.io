							<p class="card-text">My name is <b>Zsolt Szir√°czki</b>.</p>
							<p class="card-text">I have created this webpage to introduce myself.</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								I am a <b>software developer</b> in London. I am interested in a lot of things in programming (maybe too many). I have used many languages, 
								for example C#, C++ and many more.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								Currently I work with C#, ReactJS, NodeJS with AWS. But I have used PHP with JS and MySQL too.
								<br/>
								In my free time, I use C# for my Unity projects and C++ for my Game Engine project.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								We have a saying in my country. The good priest studies until their death. I think this is really true for developers.
								As a result, I spend time evolving my skills or I just try new technologies. In my free time,
								I use Unity and I create smaller/bigger games. I have made a game with VR and AR features.
								I learnt ML a bit, because I am interested in it, how they work.
								<br/>
								In the last year, I have started to create a Game Engine with C++ and OpenGL.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of programming, I like going to the cinema, playing video games and spending time with my friends. I spent
								a lot of time playing World of Warcraft. But my favorite video game series is Gothic.
								I am interested in mythologies (mostly Greek and Egyptian).
